**Identity**

**Issuing a new identity to a participant**
Make sure the participant is created before this step.

You can connect to your Hyperledger Composer playground.

In order to onboard a new participant in your network you should issue a new ID. You have to goto 'ID Registry' dropdown in the top right corner. You will see any existing IDs and an option to Issue New ID. ![alt text](https://github.com/odysseyhack/kpn-technium/blob/master/BusinessNetworkLedger/docs/images/ID_Registry.png)

On the Identity Server(for this project I have used Github) configure the details. Every participant must have his own identity registered on identity server.
Fill the details with the HOST and PORT details of your server where your business network is setup. ![alt text](https://github.com/odysseyhack/kpn-technium/blob/master/BusinessNetworkLedger/docs/images/Register_OAuth.png)
